# A Multi-Framework [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) Library Installer

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/composer/installers.png)](http://travis-ci.org/composer/installers)

This is for PHP package authors to require in their `composer.json`. It will
magically install their package to the correct location based on the specified
package type.

**Current Supported Package Types**:

* CakePHP 2+   `cakephp-`
* CodeIgniter  `codeigniter-`
* Drupal       `drupal-`
* FuelPHP      `fuelphp-`
* Joomla       `joomla-`
* Laravel      `laravel-`
* Lithium      `lithium-`
* Magento      `magento-`
* phpBB        `phpbb-`
* PPI          `ppi-`
* Symfony1     `symfony1-`
* WordPress    `wordpress-`
* Zend         `zend-`

## Example `composer.json` File

This is an example for a CakePHP plugin. The only important parts to set in your
composer.json file are `"type": "cakephp-plugin"` which describes what your
package is and `"require": { "composer/installers": "*" }` which tells composer
to load the custom installers.

``` json
{
    "name": "you/ftp",
    "type": "cakephp-plugin",
    "require": {
        "composer/installers": "*"
    }
}
```

This would install your package to the `app/Plugin/Ftp/` folder of a CakePHP app
when a user runs `php composer.phar install`.

So submit your packages to [packagist.org](http://packagist.org)!
